Additionally, we could think about the revenue generated for the two companies as it is the ultimate goal. If cab drivers are indeed serving
both cities, there should be more revenue generated.

Next, we would also have to think about some drive partners could use the free tolls for personal use rather than company use. In such
cases, this would result in a net loss or net zero. Both of which are undesirable results.

Let us assume a best case scenario where the experiment was successful and this system of tolls reimbursement was introduced. Let us also
assume that it worked out well for a few months and the companies recorded a hike in revenues generated. But what if this fades away
with time? What if there's a new company in town that offers cheaper/more affordable rates? Can the two companies compete with this new player?
What would be the impact of drivers using free tolls for personal gain? Or what if the increase in revenues is seasonal?Would it beneficial to
implement this all year round?

These are the questions that the companies business partners and technical analysts must consider and be ready to counteract these 
uninvited outcomes.
